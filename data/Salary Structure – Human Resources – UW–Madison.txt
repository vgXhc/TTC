  Salary Structure

UW–Madison developed a market-informed title and salary structure to
attract, retain, and reward employees as a result of the Title and Total
(TTC) Compensation Project
<https://hr.wisc.edu/title-and-total-compensation-study/>. Every
university job has been assigned to a salary grade in the salary structure.

The Title and Standard Job Description Library
<https://hr.wisc.edu/standard-job-descriptions/> includes all salary
ranges, standard job descriptions and titles for every job at the
university.


    Salary Ranges

Job assigned to salary grades 15–35 are the new salary structure that
was created during the TTC Project.

Salary ranges can be viewed annually or hourly using the options below.

Employees paid over nine months can view their salary range by clicking
Academic (9-month) Salary or Academic (9-month) Hourly buttons below.

    Other Salary Ranges

Salary grades 51–99 are not included in the new salary structure for the
TTC Project. These salary ranges remain the same. Board of Regents
policies, trades negotiations, and faculty data are a few examples of
factors that may influence the salary ranges listed below. There is no
uniform organization to these grades. The university will continue to
evaluate these factors in its long-term compensation strategy.
